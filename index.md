# Jazmin Bembry's Portfolio

Welcome to my Portfolio! This is a blog-styled website hosted by GitHub Pages that I will be using to journal all of my assignments during my time taking the CS46X series of classes at Western Oregon Univesity. It is at this website that I will be discussing and demonstrating what I  have learned and the processes and code that I use to make things work. 

# About Me

I am a senior in the Computer Science Program at Western Oregon University. During this last year of my undergraduate, I am taking a series of 3 classes: CS 460, CS 461, and CS462. It is in these classes that I will learn about software engineering ad developemnt methodologies. Not only that, but I will be learning HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, Git, Javascript/jQuery, C#, ASP.NET MVC5, and much more. The assignments published here will illustrate what I have learned. 

# Code Repository 

All code can be seen here in a separate repository:
