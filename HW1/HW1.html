        <h1 align="center">Portland's Hip-Hop/Rap Scene</h1>
        <p2>During the summer before my senior year at Western Oregon, I worked as a 
            Data Engineer Intern for Urban Airship in Portland. After spending 3 months 
            immersing myself into Portland and its culture, I fell in love with the city.
            For this website, I feel it is only right talk about the intersection of 
            two of my favorite things: Portland and Rap music. In the navigation bar above,
            you can visit pages on the history of the Portland rap scene, information about some
            of the most prevalent artists today, and where you can find rap music and shows 
            in the city. Enjoy! </p2>
