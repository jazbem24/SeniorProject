        <h1 align="center">The History of Portland Rap</h1>
        <p3>Portland Hip-Hop has come a long way, but it still has so far to go, a lot 
            like the city of Portland. Many would not expect that Portland doesn't have a hip-hop/rap scene, but alas there is. It has just recently started to thrive with the emergence of hip-hop culture shops and galleries, Rap/hip-hop showcases, and artists that are starting to become popular, especially with the role that the internet now plays in the global music scene. The scene has gone through a lot, especially with the roles that gentrification has tested the culture. Some of the ways that gentrification and discrimination has threatened Portland hip-hop is listed below:</p3>

        <ol>
            <li>Many hip-hop venues in the city have been shut down permanentlyby the Portland police</li>
            <li>Over displays of authority, including gang enforcement officers, enforcing color dress codes in minority neighborhoods</li>
            <li>Minorities and musical talent have been pushed further and further out of the city</li>
        </ol>
