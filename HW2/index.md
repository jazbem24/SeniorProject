# Homework 2 

For this assignment, the goal is to demonstrate basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and how they all work together to make a responsive website. 

# Step 1: Set up the Enviroment 

First, I need to set up my enviroment. I started by creating a HW2 directory, and created a style.css and index.html, since those are needed. Also, I created a index.md file to start journaling the process.

```
 mkdir HW2
 cd HW2
 touch style.css
 touch index.html
 touch index.md 
 ```
 Next, I created a  new branch to start working.
 
 ```
 git branch feature_branch master
 git checkout feature_branch
  ```
  
Now that I have place to start, I added the files and pushed the branch to the remote repo.

```
 git add . 
 git commit -m "Added hw2 files" 
 git push origin feature_branch
 ```
# Step 2: Creating a Wireframe

Now that I have a good starting point, I need to create a wireframe to use as a layout for the website. I creatd this wireframe using MockFlow. MockFlow is an online wireframe,prototyping,and UI mockup tool.
